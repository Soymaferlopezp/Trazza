<h1 align="center">Trazza - Mountain Coffee Traceability Platform
</h1>

<p align="center">
Trazza is a web platform that <strong>verifies the origin and authenticity of mountain coffee, empowering producers, brands, and buyers.</strong>Through a symbolic traceability system, verifiable certificates, and a clear visualization of the supply chain, the platform connects the story behind every coffee bean with the people who enjoy it.

## üöÄ Key Features

- Symbolic Traceability: Producers can register their coffee lots and tell the story of their cultivation.

- Verifiable Certificates and QRs: Generation of unique certificates and QR codes for each batch, allowing buyers to verify the origin with a simple scan.

- User Profiles: Personalized dashboards for Producers, Coffee Brands, and Buyers, adapted to their specific needs.

- Data Visualization: Simulation of key data such as IoT sensor information and predictive quality analysis.

- Simulated Technologies: Visual representation of technologies like blockchain (public ledger) and AI.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Visual Mock Use Cases

This project is a functional visual mock, not a full backend application. It's designed to simulate the following functionalities:

### Producer
* Registering coffee lots.
* Generating public profiles and certificates.
* Viewing simulated lot statistics.

### Coffee Brand
* Exploring producer profiles.
* Accessing the traceability of associated lots.
* Downloading simulated certificates.

### Buyer / Exporter
* Simulated QR code scanning to verify origin.
* Full lot traceability visualization.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Local Run

Since this is a visual mock generated in Bolt.new, the local setup is minimal.

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Soymaferlopezp/Trazza.git](https://github.com/Soymaferlopezp/Trazza.git)
    cd trazza-project
    ```
2.  **Open the project**: You can open the project folder in your preferred code editor (like VS Code) and use a `Live Server` extension to view it in your browser.
